IDEAS:
- implement a feature so that you can always click the bookmark and it will return to the progress page
- add event listeners so that you can toggle commonly used areas with keyboard shortcuts
- add reminders for assignments
- show missing assignemnts easier
- show assignments that are a day prior (maybe in a different color)
- Add a color scheme feature with support for new colors
  - Have a text entry box (that is safe for javascript) that allows a person to copy and paste color schemes
  - Have a github file for commonly used color schemes
