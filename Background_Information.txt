Hi this is Matt Marsico. I began working on this on Friday, October 15, 2021.
Class of 2023 - St. Francis

The purpose of this repository is a combination of the following
- practice larger scale projects with focus on supportability and updateability (I want to be able to mold this app to fit students' needs)
- apply some functional programming ideas and see how they affect supportability
- create a better version of OnCampusPlus because the GPA and grade calculator was not technically correct.
- have a good portfolio project
  - To expand on this, I understand that people outside of the St. Francis student body will not be able to use this so I will figure out a way to demonstrate its use
- get better at using GitHub

If you are reading this as a...
- developer
  - I encourage you to improve my design and let me know if you find any bugs. Or make this project your own - copy and paste what I have and add your own        functionality
- regular joe
  - Let me know what features you would like to be implemented. I also know that other schools use the same platform as me so if you do not go to St. Francis, it makes me very happy that my project has made it all the way to you.

Thank for reading and if you have any questions...
email: mjmarsico@hotmail.com     NOTE: I do get a lot of emails so I may not check this.
phone: 630-200-1522      NOTE: If you sign me up for a bunch of spam calls.... Then you're not nice. Send me a text saying that you read this because I will likely dismiss it if you don't
Have a good DAY!!!!!

- Matt
